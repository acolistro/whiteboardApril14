Prompt #1: Painters
Compose a function called paint() and then add it to three different painters. Each painter can only paint with one color. This should be the end result:

> painter1.paints()
"Paints green!"
> painter2.paints()
"Paints yellow!"
> painter3.paints()
"Paints red!"

paint(1 color)


const changeState = (prop) => {
  return (value) => {
    return (state) => ({
      ...state,
      [prop] : (state[value] || null )
      [prop] : `Paints ${state.color}!`
    })
  }
}
const makeColorGreen = changestate(color)(green)
changestate(painter1)



const painter1 = { color: "green" };
const painter2 = { color: "yellow" };
const painter3 = { color: "red" };

const p1 = changeState("green")(color)

function whichPainter(painter) {
  const paints = function() {
    return `Paints ${painter.color}!`
  }
}

const painter1 = whichPainter(p1);
